        <hpt>9. Procedure for Alleging Copyright Infringement</hpt>
        <p class="a">
        CADET will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
        <br>
        If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by CADET infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a written notification pursuant to the DMCA, by providing our DMCA Agent with the information listed below (and as further set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked:
        
        </p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Identification in sufficient detail of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works on the Service are covered by a single notification, you may provide a representative list of such works on the Service, however, the representative list must still contain sufficient detail of the copyrighted works so that we can identify them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Service that contains the material that you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information to enable us to locate the alleged infringing material(s), so that we can comply with your request to remove or deny access to it/them;</li>
            <br>
            <li>Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) to permit us to contact you, if necessary;</li>
            <br>
            <li>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the owner&apos;s behalf;</li>
            <br>
            <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
            <br>
            <li>A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information contained in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="a">
        You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 9.1, your DMCA notice will not be valid.
        <br><br>
        You must submit any notification of an alleged copyright infringement to CADET&apos;s DMCA Agent by fax, mail, or email as set forth below:

        <p class="a">
        The Service (excluding any linked websites) is governed by the laws of the United States of America.  You shall comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your use of the Website and Service.  Although the Service may be accessible worldwide, we make no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing them from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited.  Those who choose to access the Service from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

        <hpt>16. Dispute Resolution</hpt>
        <p class="a">
        A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.  You and CADET agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service shall be heard under New York law and must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
        <br><br>
        You hereby specifically acknowledge, agree and consent that you waive your right to a trial, by jury or otherwise, and that you agree that any suit, action, proceeding, dispute, controversy or claim (“Dispute”) arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service or any of the transactions contemplated herein or related to the Service or any contests or services thereon will be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures.  All parties shall first attempt to negotiate all Disputes informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration.  Such informal negotiations shall commence following the receipt of a notice in writing by one of the parties sent to the other.  CADET will send its notice to your billing address, if provided, and email you a copy to the email address you have provided to us, if any.  You may send any notice to CADET to the addresses listed below.
        <br><br>
        If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations the Dispute shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator.  Such Dispute shall be arbitrated within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.  If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you or in the State of California where CADET is located.  For residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California using the English language in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect, by one arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of AAA arbitrators.  The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by an arbitrator rather than a court.  The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under these Terms of Service shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.  Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.  Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.
        <br><br>
        The parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between you and CADET individually.  To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis and you agree to no class action as set forth below; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
        <br><br>
        If you have a dispute with another user of the Service, you release CADET (and CADET&apos;s officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.  CADET, at its sole discretion, may try to help resolve disputes between users; however it has no obligation to do so.
        <br><br>
        No Class Action Matters. YOU AND CADET AGREE THAT WITH RESPECT TO ARBITRATION DISPUTES EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. All Disputes will be heard or arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other claims or arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that the restriction set forth in this Section is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in the courts located within the State of California. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained in this “No Class Action Matters” section, are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.
